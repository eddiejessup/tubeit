Rquirements:
- Django
- Django-Bootstrap-Toolkit (https://github.com/dyve/django-bootstrap-toolkit)



To try it out:
	- Install django
	- Run "python manage.py runserver" in the directory where manage.py lives, it is believed to be in Tubego
	- Browse your internets to localhost:8000/map/search
	- Enter a map search query (e.g. Paris if you're feeling romantic/have no imagination) and a radius in metres (e.g. 100, other integers are available) within which to scrape locations
	- Await magic
	- Be disappointed

Notes:
	- One of the more forward-thinking authors of this code has migrated to python 3, print statements may be considered harmful, i.e. print() is a fucking function.
