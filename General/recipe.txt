recipe for a tube map:
- pick ~15 of the outermost vertices of the system (forming termina)
- connect some of these vertices in ~pairs (forming lines)
- collapse some inner vertices onto lines to which they lie close (forming junctions)
- form some inner vertices into ~2 loop lines (forming lines and junctions)
- branch lines to isolated outer vertices (forming branched termina)

unconsidered:
- zones
- rail
